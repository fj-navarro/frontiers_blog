Addressing business transformation involves developing capabilities to quickly adapt to predictable and unpredictable environmental changes and create and capture new value. Events such as the appearance of new technologies and disruptive/innovative business models, the shortening of product life cycles, and a more dynamic competitive landscape require new strategic responses from business firms. 

Those organizations that take a step forward and commit themselves to deep business transformation do so by adopting different combinations of information technologies, processes, and resources that end up impacting the entire organization and leading to profound changes in its structure, culture, and behavior.

## Ambidexterity Explained
Deep transformation initiatives deliberately introduce organizational changes that are global and pursue ambidexterity, namely, the simultaneous combination of two different modes of operation within the firm.

On the one hand, the exploitation mode, focused on the most efficient and flexible use of the existing organizational knowledge base. On the other hand, the exploration mode, which seeks to go beyond the current base of knowledge and skills of the organization and focuses on the search for new sources of knowledge, resources, and the acquisition of new skills that encourage speed, experimentation, and innovation. 

What is the difference between exploitation and exploration modes?

Both modes differ in terms of strategy, structure, processes, and culture, so organizations undergoing transformation must learn to find the right balance between the two, avoiding overweighting one mode over the other.

## How to Approach Ambidexterity Effectively?
There are many approaches to achieving ambidexterity in the firm that usually encompass different initiatives at various levels, these basically can be grouped into the following:

- Cultural change initiatives.
- New organizational structures, including new roles and responsibilities.
- New processes aimed at continuous innovation and collaboration with partners.

In general, companies will use different approaches in their exploration and exploitation strategies. 

Companies typically implement traditional strategies for exploitation that establish the strategic direction to be followed by the organization, allocate resources, and set up priorities. This highly programmed way of introducing change into the organization can slow down (if not prevent) the exploration of new transformation scenarios. For this reason, companies very often use open and agile strategies for exploration that guide the discovery of new possibilities.

## Organizing for Structural Ambidexterity
Organizations sometimes create dual structures to make ambidexterity structural, meaning that they simultaneously maintain a traditional organizational structure for the exploitation mode and another open and agile structure for the exploration mode. 

On other occasions, firms establish hybrid configurations when justified by the need to combine both approaches. Very often this means that multiple transformation initiatives come together in the same organization, adding even more complexity to the transformation process. 

In these cases, it is crucial that each transformation initiative is aligned with the overall strategic vision of the company. To do this, organizations usually create a specific unit with people dedicated to coordinating all initiatives and ensuring synchronization and collaboration in accordance with established business objectives.

## Ambidexterity with People
Most of the time managing multiple concurrent transformation initiatives and the consequent structural and cultural changes that occur pose a challenge for organizations, even more so the smaller the organization. This explains why, in today's highly complex business environment, there are many companies implementing a governance framework for transformation initiatives that regulates resources and responsibilities and seeks to seamlessly integrate them with business, IT and people functions.

Usually this is the best way to reduce resistance to change and overcome the inertias that impede organizational change, replacing them with new innovative and more collaborative capabilities instead. Ultimately, transformational leaders should not forget that the transformation of a business organization needs to be made by and designed for people, so employees are always at the center of any business transformation strategy. 

Interpersonal and cultural aspects play a crucial role in a successful organizational transformation strategies, which should be based on communication and leadership as tools that facilitate the collaboration of employees in the business and IT areas. Maintaining continuous personal interactions at all levels, understanding the objectives pursued, and sharing the necessary knowledge not only should help to reduce the economic and social costs of organizational transformation, but also contribute to accelerating the whole transformation process.
