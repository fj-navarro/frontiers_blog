**Ethical considerations arising from business transformation often go unnoticed by transformational leaders, and even more so by the ICT industry and other key stakeholders who should pay attention to this key driver of transformation.**

However, ethical behavior in business transformation, as in other complex decision-making environments, plays a fundamental role in achieving the expected results and establishing solid foundations on which to build a robust and smooth transformation.

Through proper examination of the ethical considerations that arise from transformation, transformational leaders can gain new perspectives to understand both the transformation processes themselves and the new organizational and societal impacts that are emerging.

## Ethics in the Era of Data
The importance of ethics becomes more apparent as business transformation becomes more and more data-driven, extends to an ever-increasing number of actors, and becomes deeper and irreversible for most organizations.

The massive adoption of data by organizations in virtually every industry and the implementation of smart technologies are factors that will drive innovation and support competitive advantage. However, these profound transformation processes are beginning to raise ethical questions that can undermine the credibility of many organizations and call into question the way they are carrying out their transformation roadmap, with its consequential negative impact on performance and results.

Transformational leaders must begin to answer questions like, how are fundamental values such as privacy, security, equality, transparency, and autonomy going to be affected in a world dominated by Big Data and smart technologies? Should some data be a public good? To what extent will consumers be willing to reveal personal data in exchange for making society safer and more efficient?

Whatever the answers, the bottom line is that transformational leaders need to start deciding how they plan to implement ethical practices within the organization (e.g., ethical Big Data, ethical analytics, ethical AI) and how they are going to be communicated both within and outside the organization.

Consequently, ethics should be seen as a complementary approach that helps transformational leaders to envision multifaceted perspectives of transformation processes, while being aware that it is a phenomenon that has not yet been studied in depth.

This does not mean that ethics should be used as a safeguard against the way data-driven transformation is taking place, but rather as an additional dimension that should help organizations strike a better balance between the elements that drive change and those that sustain performance over time.

## Ethics and Employees
A key aspect that transformational leaders must pay attention to when dealing with the ethical aspects derived from transformation is the relationship that exists between them and the organization's employees.

Transformational leaders must strive to ensure that business objectives do not conflict with the moral views of their employees, even though this may sometimes be contradictory to the company's own financial objectives.

Transformational leaders must seek to align business model decisions with employee values and principles, as well as keep all the capabilities offered by data and smart technologies on the same ethical plane as those who are their users.

To illustrate the relevance of this topic, take the case of Google and see how the company changed its well-known motto “Don’t be evil” in the 2018 Code of Ethics revision to its equally popular statement: “And remember … don’t be evil and if you see something that you think isn’t right – speak up!”

Despite this powerful claim, the tech company has been criticized many times in recent years by US regulators and its broad community of critics for the way key ethical issues are handled at the corporate level and by its employees.

## Ethics and Performance
As the business environment becomes more complex, the possibility for a company to maintain full control over its level of performance becomes a challenge. In this context, ethics plays a key role as it can guide transformational leaders in designing and using new technologies and processes that make it easier to achieve short-term goals, while sustaining the company's performance level in the long term.

For example, some companies may try to increase their proximity to the customer and personalize their experiences by anticipating latent preferences that are not always made explicit through primary and secondary data sources. Although these practices may be profitable for the company’s performance in the short term, they are sometimes shown to be undesirable, not because they are illegal, but because some stakeholders consider them morally reprehensible.

Therefore, transformational leaders must remain vigilant to these risks, as customers and other stakeholders are bound to become critical if certain moral values are violated. In addition, it is important for companies to demonstrate that they are using data responsibly and are not only focused on the business case.

To properly assess ethical risks, every transformational leader must begin by taking the customer's point of view and asking themselves: Would the customer agree to disclose their data if they knew exactly what was being done with it? What are the possible benefits that customers would be willing to accept to provide their data ?

Ultimately, transformational leaders must review the ethical foundations currently in force in their organizations (for example, corporate social responsibility) in light of business transformation, incorporating new areas of interest such as ethical performance, data governance, etc. By doing so, companies will gain a much more complete and rich understanding of the transformation phenomenon that will surely allow them to approach the process more successfully.

## Ethics and Stakeholders
As value creation networks increase in complexity, companies must satisfy the multiple, sometimes contradictory, demands of value co-creators. This issue becomes even more apparent in digital ecosystems such as platforms that, by definition, rely on multiple parties and for which data is at the core of their competitive value proposition.

Transformational leaders must develop the ability to balance the demands of multiple parties, without compromising the performance of the company or its ability to maintain its competitive advantages over time.

At times this may require the company to redefine perceptions of what is considered right and wrong. For example, for a platform owner, an ethical challenge may be how to ensure that one party’s demands are not met at the expense of others (i.e., if the platform grants access to the data to one party, then the other party should not perceive it as a breach of security and privacy).

## Conclusion
The ethical behavior of transformational leaders and people in relation to business transformation has been little studied to date, and there are still many decisions that affect transformation processes whose impact on the results and performance of organizations lacks adequate ethical understanding.

Most research on transformation in business organizations has focused on the effects it has on innovations, performance, and the factors that affect its adoption among users and consumers, or how it can become a source of competitive advantage. However, most innovations produced by transformation have social and individual impacts of an ethical nature that are much broader and go far beyond simple statements and that transformational leaders must carefully consider.

If you do not dedicate the necessary attention and the necessary resources that ethics demands, you do not do it with the right approach, or you simply do not do it at the right time, you will see how it has a strong negative impact on the results of your organization.

Ethics cannot be a matter of trial and error to find the broadest possible limits to impose a business vision, but rather it must be originally incorporated into the transformation plans of organizations by design, putting first the vision of customers, employees, and stakeholders. If you think about sustaining results in the long term, this is the right way to go.
