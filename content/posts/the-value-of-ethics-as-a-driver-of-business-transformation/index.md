The ethical considerations that arise from deep business transformation often go unnoticed by transformational leaders, not to say by the ICT industry. However, ethical behavior in business transformation (and in complex decision-making environments) plays an increasingly important role, since it can provide new perspectives to understand both the transformation processes themselves and the new organizational and social impacts that are emerging.

The importance of ethics will become more apparent as business transformation becomes more and more data-driven, extends to an ever-increasing number of actors, and becomes deeper and irreversible for most organizations. How are fundamental values such as privacy, security, equality, transparency, and autonomy going to be affected in a smarter world dominated by Big Data? Should some data be a public good? Will consumers be bound to disclose personal data to some extent to make society safer and more efficient? Whatever the answers may be, transformational leaders will need to decide how ethical practices (e.g., ethical Big Data, ethical analytics, ethical AI) are implemented within the organization, and how they are to be communicated inside and outside the organization.

Consequently, ethics should be seen as a complementary approach that helps transformational leaders to envision multifaceted perspectives of the transformation processes themselves, even more so when these have been little studied, and their impact is very high. This does not mean that ethics should be used as a safeguard against the way business transformation is taking place, but rather as an additional dimension that can help organizations strike a better balance between the elements that drive change and sustain performance over time.

## Perspectives on Ethics and Employees
Companies must ensure that their business objectives do not conflict with the moral views of their employees, even though this can sometimes be contradictory from the perspective of financial objectives. As the capabilities offered by smart technologies increase, companies must seek to align business model decisions with the values and principles of employees. 

To illustrate the relevance of this topic, take the case of Google and see how the company changed its well-known motto “Don’t be evil” in the 2018 Code of Ethics revision to its equally popular statement: “And remember … don’t be evil and if you see something that you think isn’t right – speak up!” . Despite this powerful claim, the tech company has come under fire many times in recent years by US regulators and its broad community of critics. 

## Perspectives on Ethics and Performance
As the business environment becomes more complex, the possibility for a company to maintain full control over its level of performance becomes a challenge. In this context, ethics plays a key role as it can guide the design and use of new technologies/processes to achieve short-term objectives, while making the company sustain its level of performance in the long term.

For example, some companies may try to increase their proximity to the customer and personalize their experiences by anticipating latent preferences that are not always made explicit through primary and secondary data sources. Although these practices may be profitable for the company’s performance in the short term, they have sometimes been shown to be undesirable, not because they are illegal, but because some stakeholders consider them morally reprehensible. 

Transformational leaders must remain vigilant to these risks, as customers and other stakeholders are bound to become critical if certain moral values are violated. In addition, it is important for companies to demonstrate that they are using data responsibly and are not only focused on the business case. 

To assess ethical risks, transformational leaders can start by taking the customer’s point of view and asking themselves: Would the customer agree to disclose their data if they knew exactly what was being done with it? What are the possible benefits that customers would be willing to accept to provide their data ? The ethical bases in force until now (i.e., corporate social responsibility) should be reviewed on the basis of business transformation, incorporating new areas of interest such as ethical performance, data governance, etc. By doing so, companies will obtain a more complete and richer understanding of the phenomenon of transformation that will surely allow them to address the process with greater success. 

## Perspectives on Ethics and Stakeholders
As value creation networks increase in complexity, companies must satisfy the multiple, sometimes contradictory, demands of value co-creators. This issue becomes even more apparent in digital ecosystems such as platforms that, by definition, rely on multiple parties and for which data is at the core of their competitive value proposition. 

Companies must balance the demands of multiple parties, without compromising their performance or their ability to maintain their competitive advantages over time. At times this may require a company to redefine perceptions of what is considered right and wrong. For example, for a platform owner, an ethical challenge may now be how to ensure that one party’s demands are not met at the expense of others (i.e., if the platform grants access to the data to one party, then the other party should not perceive it as a breach of security and privacy).
