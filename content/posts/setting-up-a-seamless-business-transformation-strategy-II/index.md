title: Setting Up a Successful Transformation Strategy with Smart Technologies (II)
date: "2023-06-07"
description: Companies are constantly changing, adapting their structures, resources, and objectives as they evolve to overcome the inertia that impedes change. There are different approaches when it comes to addressing business transformation that imply different ways of understanding the reasons, timing and opportunity to carry out the changes and that have consequences on the risks and costs of transformation.

### Value offerings
Smart technologies provide the ability for companies to create new value offerings from reviewing or expanding their existing portfolio of products and services. These new value offerings are determined by the organizationâ€™s ability to collect and analyze data on customers from their interactions with the products and services, as well as by incorporating increasingly innovative elements into them.

A paradigmatic example of the creation of new value offerings through smart technologies is Airbnb, whose business model is based on the ability to collect information from customers and partners and use data insights to better understand how customers travel and what accommodations they prefer when visiting a travel destination. Putting this knowledge into action means that Airbnb provides customers with real-time solutions in the form of accommodation recommendations that best suit their preferences. 

When companies equip themselves with the right smart technologies and capabilities, they are opening up new possibilities to better understand customer needs and preferences and deliver the experiences that customers want, how, where, and when they demand them.  Furthermore, companies are much closer to creating personalized value offerings and implementing value co-creation initiatives aimed at deepening customer engagement.

### Value networks
Smart technologies make it possible to redefine value networks across the whole business ecosystem. On the one hand, smart technologies give customers and users the ability to become co-creators of value, facilitating continuous communication and interaction between them and companies through online platforms, communities, social media, or online channels enabled by the firms themselves. 

On the other hand, smart technologies facilitate interaction and direct exchanges between value network participants (i.e., customers, users, firms) bypassing intermediaries and favoring new collaborative relationships between the different actors focused on value creation.

As the collaborative ties and coordination between the actors are strengthened, increasingly complex and omnidirectional relationships emerge between the stakeholders of the ecosystem that can end up creating more value for the customer. In view of these positive effects, it is key that transformational leaders encourage stakeholders to engage with smart technologies that promote the joint creation of value.

### Distribution channels
Smart technologies have a significant impact on distribution and sales channels, through which many companies are redefining the way they deliver value to the customer. Companies are using smart technologies to create new direct and bidirectional touch points and communication channels with their customers and users (i.e., social media, chatbots, IoT, communities) that foster continuous dialogue with them and close the gap between the physical and digital world.

Likewise, the use of sensors and technologies based on IoT, although still at an early stage, could contribute to making the operation of supply chains and the provision of products and services more efficient through the automation of tasks and data-driven decision-making.

### Business models
Business model transformation can create new value for organizations, especially when the new models are based on emerging technological developments and the provision of innovative services to customers. 

In some cases, the new business models completely transform the way organizations behave and compete until they practically become technology companies, such as those that offer to connect companies with users, or users with other users. In other cases, business models provide value offerings aimed at satisfying certain customer needs, such as those with lower incomes or those seeking a very particular or specialized experience.

There are also business models that aim to create new value using disruptive technologies to find solutions to problems related to sustainability or the shared economy. This is the case, for example, of the new business models arising from sustainable mobility (i.e., car and bike sharing), which lead to new products and services that improve the customer experience. 

In recent years, business models based on digital platforms have also emerged that facilitate communication and connection between the different actors in the business ecosystem. An example are reservation and exchange platforms in the accommodation sector (i.e., Booking.com, Airbnb), which create new value propositions for customers based on cost reduction and the integration of value-added services.

### Organizational agility
Smart technologies can help companies cope with changes in their environment and adapt more quickly to them. This is possible when companies speed organizational agility, which means developing the ability to acquire knowledge about the environment, detect opportunities, and be able to coordinate responses quickly and accurately. 

Systems combining Big Data, data analytics, AI, and IoT provide a huge amount of information and processing capacity that can be used by companies to detect untapped opportunities, increase customer knowledge, and, ultimately, create new customer-centric value. 

For example, a company can anticipate the preferences of its customers and offer personalized experiences based on the accumulated knowledge of the customer and the conditions of the context. In this way, smart technologies can drive ambidexterity in the organization, as they encourage exploration through smart innovation and exploitation of existing resources.
