**Companies willing to move towards data-driven management should start to think about improving their agility, which means having a good understanding of what an Agile framework is about and choosing which Agile practices and methodologies are best suited to implement in their data projects.**

Indeed, one major stumbling block for the adoption of an Agile framework in data-driven projects is the sometimes ill-informed choice of suitable tools and techniques that are valuable to teams. So, **what Agile practices can be applied to data-driven projects to effectively improve the organization’s business performance?**

A thorough discussion on the Agile principles that are best suited to data projects and how they differ from traditional methods can be a good starting point for any transformational leader. Some of the most important ones are presented below.

## Incremental and iterative development
The Agile project development philosophy is embodied in iterative, short, incremental development cycles that are executed in an evolutionary style. Agile development cycles replace the traditional waterfall style by prioritizing the development of those requirements that the user values and continuously adapt development tasks as the customer or user provides feedback to the team. 

In each iteration, the team produces incremental improvements to the final product that are quickly made available to the customer/user for feedback. These iterations generally last from 2 to 4 weeks, although the final time depends on the nature of the tasks involved. 

## Collaboration and self-management
Agile data projects enable mechanisms that promote collaboration among team members, as well as between team members and the customer/end user. Agile teams, unlike traditional project management teams, are independent and self-organizing to manage their tasks and make their own decisions. 

Agile teams decide the sequence in which the development tasks are carried out in each iteration and are responsible for the deliveries to the customer/user according to the committed requirements. Furthermore, Agile team members are discouraged from performing routine or repetitive tasks manually and, if there are any, attempts are made to replace them with automated tasks. 

## Interactions between individuals
In the world of Big Data and analytics, it is essential to work quickly to create value, moving from data to knowledge and from knowledge to the interpretation of results in an Agile way. The heaviest analytics processes (e.g., processes with transactional data) that used to take days to complete are now performed in just a few minutes using new Big Data technologies. 

New professional profiles have emerged, such as the Chief Data Officer and data scientists, who are increasingly in charge of data processes. They put Agile principles into practice by applying machine learning algorithms for iterative pattern discovery and seek ongoing interaction with stakeholders for interpretation and guidance.

## Early and continuous testing
For Agile teams to continuously deliver incremental data products to customers/users, they need to set up testing mechanisms in advance and test very frequently. Having automated test systems (e.g., analytics-driven testing) makes it easy for teams to test early in the development cycle and ensures that the data products created are reliable and accurate to customer specifications. 

On other occasions, Agile teams may use test-driven development whereby developers write a test after they have developed enough code to fail. After the first tests are completed, the code is updated, and new tests are rerun as needed until approved. If the code fails, the developers update the working code and test it again.  

## Speed of data analysis
As Big Data and data analytics projects are running at an ever-increasing speed, producing comprehensive documentation in data projects does not seem the best practice. A basic principle of Agile teams is that documentation is not essential, but communication is. 

As long as Agile teams meet the requirements of product development and these have been properly tested, not much literature is needed to explain things. Moreover, complete documentation not only does not help ensure the success of the project but may even contribute to its failure. 

## Response to change
In data project management, the traditional approach generally involves signing a contract between customer and provider with terms that tend to be as complete and detailed as possible. Any change in the conditions established in the contract is considered negative and the parties must try to do everything possible to avoid it. 

In Big Data and analytics projects, change is the rule, not the exception, as input data is constantly changing and is not structured or clean enough to be processed. Therefore, being prepared to respond to the changing conditions is a must in data projects. Unlike the traditional approach, the Agile approach attempts to eliminate the bureaucracy and resources required to draft a comprehensive contract between the parties.  

## Collaboration and communication
While contracts may address expectations of collaboration between stakeholders at the beginning of a data project, it is difficult to gather all the necessary requirements, more specifically in Big Data and analytics projects, as they are often unknown, and it is difficult to anticipate all needs in advance. 

The way to solve this is to increase communication between stakeholders to continually approximate expectations and achieve a satisfactory delivery. The need to communicate effectively becomes a critical factor in developing an Agile data project. Agile communication encompasses all that occurs between team members, with customers and end users, as well as with operations staff and the company’s management.

## Continuous Delivery
Continuous Delivery is a set of activities and workflow automation process used to develop a new functionality or feature, from ideation to delivery of value to the customer or end user. When companies use a Continuous Delivery approach, development-to-production time can be dramatically reduced, and data Agile teams can focus more on delivering quality data products.

Once the Agile team receives customer or user feedback, it takes immediate action to implement that feedback. The team uses the feedback received to learn and improve. Improvements can be introduced throughout the development process, or can be made to the product delivered.
