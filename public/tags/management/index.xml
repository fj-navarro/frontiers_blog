Value offerings Smart technologies provide the ability for companies to create new value offerings from reviewing or expanding their existing portfolio of products and services. These new value offerings are determined by the organizationâ€™s ability to collect and analyze data on customers from their interactions with the products and services, as well as by incorporating increasingly innovative elements into them.
A paradigmatic example of the creation of new value offerings through smart technologies is Airbnb, whose business model is based on the ability to collect information from customers and partners and use data insights to better understand how customers travel and what accommodations they prefer when visiting a travel destination.</description>

      <description>Smart organizations are constantly changing, adapting their structures, resources, and objectives as they evolve to overcome the inertia that impedes change. Building a transformation strategy on top of the dynamic capabilities and ambidexterity of the company and through the implementation of multiple simultaneous projects is an effective way to reduce risks and have better cost performance.
This is different from those organizations that perceive the need to transform as a result of episodic external events (or disruptions) that alter a previous equilibrium situation and that affect the internal structures of the organization, which must then be replaced by others.</description>

      <description>Addressing business transformation involves developing capabilities to quickly adapt to predictable and unpredictable environmental changes and create and capture new value. Events such as the appearance of new technologies and disruptive/innovative business models, the shortening of product life cycles, and a more dynamic competitive landscape require new strategic responses from business organizations.
Those organizations that take a step forward and commit themselves to deep business transformation do so by adopting different combinations of information technologies, processes, and resources that end up impacting the entire organization and leading to profound changes in its structure, culture, and behavior.</description>

      <description>In the new era of data and smart technologies, the consumer is king when companies must decide on new technologies and business transformation. In these new times, the tangible resources (including the tangible products) on which the fundamental competitive capabilities of businesses were based are beginning to lose relevance in favor of the intangible assets and services delivered by the organization. Furthermore, the ability of organizations to open up to the outside world and interact with other players in multiple business ecosystems becomes critical.</description>
