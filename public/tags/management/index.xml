      <description>Smart organizations are constantly changing, adapting their structures, resources, and objectives as they evolve to overcome the inertia that impedes change. Building a transformation strategy on top of the dynamic capabilities and ambidexterity of the organization, and through the implementation of multiple simultaneous projects is an effective way to reduce risks and have better cost performance.
This approach when setting the business transformation strategy is different when organizations perceive the need to transform as a result of episodic external events (aka, disruptions) that alter a previous equilibrium situation and that affect the organization&amp;rsquo;s internal structures, forcing them to be replaced by others.</description>

      <description>In today&amp;rsquo;s complex business context, addressing business transformation means that organizations must develop new capabilities to quickly adapt to both predictable and unpredictable environmental changes and create (and capture) new value.
External events such as the emergence of new technologies and new disruptive and innovative business models, the shortening of product life cycles and a more dynamic competitive landscape require new strategic responses.
Transformational leaders often address this challenge by adopting different combinations of information technologies, processes and resources that greatly affect the entire organization and lead to radical changes in its structure, culture, and behavior.</description>
