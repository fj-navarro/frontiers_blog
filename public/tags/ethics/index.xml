      <description>The ethical considerations that arise from deep business transformation often go unnoticed by transformational leaders, not to say by the ICT industry. However, ethical behavior in business transformation (and in complex decision-making environments) plays an increasingly important role, since it can provide new perspectives to understand both the transformation processes themselves and the new organizational and social impacts that are emerging.
The importance of ethics will become more apparent as business transformation becomes more and more data-driven, extends to an ever-increasing number of actors, and becomes deeper and irreversible for most organizations.</description>
