      <description>The seamless integration of Big Data, Analytics and AI (BDAI) into solutions that meet the changing needs of business is starting to generate great business opportunities and competitive advantages for companies in all industries around the world.
Simultaneously, the rise of the &amp;ldquo;as-a-service&amp;rdquo; trend is gaining momentum thanks to the proliferation of the amount of data available and the exponential increase in computing capabilities. Not to mention that more and more companies have access to IT infrastructure and applications as a service through the cloud.</description>

      <description>Cognitive computing technologies are fundamentally different from all other forms of computing seen so far. They aim to continually learn from the interaction between data (structured and unstructured), context, and people, to improve learning and reasoning capabilities over time.
Similar to how human learning evolves from birth to adulthood, a cognitive system learns and becomes more intelligent over time from the information it gains each time it interacts with its environment and the experience it accumulates.</description>

      <description>The idea of quantum computing arose from the reflection made by scientists about the fundamental limits of computing. What they surmised is that if technology continued to comply with Mooreâ€™s Law (which states that the number of transistors in a microprocessor doubles approximately every 2 years), then the shrinking size of the circuits within a silicon chip would eventually reach a point where individual elements would not exceed the size of a few atoms.</description>
