      <p>Building a transformation strategy on top of the dynamic capabilities and <a href="/posts/the-art-of-ambidexterity-crucial-for-organizational-transformation/">ambidexterity</a> of the company through the implementation of multiple simultaneous projects is an effective way to reduce risks and have better cost performance.</p>
<p>Smart organizations are constantly changing, adapting their structures, resources, and objectives as they evolve to overcome the inertia that impedes change. This is different from those organizations that perceive the need to transform as a result of episodic external events (or disruptions) that alter a previous equilibrium situation and that affect the internal structures of the organization, which must then be replaced by others.</p>
<h2 id="episodic-vs-continuous-transformation-approach">Episodic vs Continuous Transformation Approach</h2>
<p>The continuous change approach to business transformation entails a micro-level perspective, as opposed to the macro-level involved in the episodic change approach. The former does not only respond to external changes that abruptly shake the organization at specific moments (i.e., when a new technology appears), but is substantially driven by the continuous evolution of the contextual conditions in which the organization operates (i.e., by the continuous interaction with customers, the evolution of customers’ consumption expectations, etc.).</p>
<p>It is precisely the constant evolution of these contextual conditions, and the complexity arising from the growing interconnection between the actors of the business ecosystems, which determines the degree of transformation that the company will require: from continuous incremental micro-adaptations to more profound selective changes that introduce new organizational configurations. Ultimately, the organization should always remain aligned with the contextual conditions in which it operates, seeking an adequate balance between continuous and episodic change.</p>
<h2 id="forget-about-reaching-equilibrium">Forget About Reaching Equilibrium</h2>
<p>Equilibrium situations are not expected to be reached any time soon after external changes or disruptions occur in a business ecosystem. Rather, very often changes occur in cascade and their consequences are unpredictable.</p>
<p>For this reason, it would be better for transformational leaders to approach their transformational strategies from the paradigm of continuous change, which means assuming that the organization and its structure become malleable and are always prepared to address an endless number of micro changes that will take place continuously over time.</p>
<p>However, despite the predominance of the continuous change approach, the above does not rule out the need for companies to respond to episodic or disruptive changes that may occur in its environment, even more so when these episodic changes can be the precursors of continuous changes.</p>
<h2 id="from-theory-to-practice">From Theory to Practice</h2>
<p>All activities aimed at implementing a transformation strategy and creating value for the organization must be converted into concrete actions. Hence, transformational leaders should always remember that deciding to implement technologies is not going to add direct value to the organization on its own.
Only when transformational leaders become aware of the specific context in which technologies operate and pursue specific and ambitious transformation goals can the company discover new ways to create value. Therefore, a successful smart transformation strategy will depend on the emphasis that leaders place on preparing the organization’s value creation processes for change, acting more specifically in the five areas that are discussed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Value offerings</li>
<li>Value networks</li>
<li>Digital channels</li>
<li>Business model</li>
<li>Organizational agility</li>
</ul>
<p>Acting in these areas can be a source of inspiration to create innovative products and services, optimize key business processes, improve decision-making, and evolve to an agile culture that finally leads to a smart data-driven organization.</p>
