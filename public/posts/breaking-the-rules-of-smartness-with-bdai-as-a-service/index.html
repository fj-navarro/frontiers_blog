      <p>The combination of Big Data, analytics, and AI (BDAI) is going to generate great business opportunities and competitive advantages for companies around the world. Through the integration and interoperability of these technologies, companies are going to be able to transform their operations and business model and, in the medium and long term, obtain significant gains in efficiency and productivity.</p>
<p>It can be expected that the inclusion of BDAI in the culture of people will better prepare organizations to open new markets and explore (and exploit) new niches in existing markets, will allow the creation of new value offerings focused on the experiential component and personalization, and, ultimately, will contribute significantly to boosting growth.</p>
<p>With the proliferation of available data and computing capabilities increasing at an exponential rate, BDAI technologies are gaining momentum. The rise of the “as-a-Service” trend is contributing significantly to this growth, with more companies having access to IT infrastructures and applications as a service though the cloud. BDAI-as-a-Service (BDAIaaS) thus represents a source of great opportunities to accelerate the incorporation of any company, no matter its size or industry, to the benefits of Smart transformation.</p>
<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>
<p>BDAIaaS is an approach to provide companies with access to the infrastructure, hardware, and software necessary for Big Data, analytics, and AI capabilities. Through this model of access and use of IT, companies can increase the pace of adoption of smart technologies, instead of keeping it slow. BDAIaaS offers an integrated service that merges different capabilities and technologies that are very complex by nature, making it easy for users to work with them by combining:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Platform as a Service (PaaS), so that access to the infrastructure, operating system, and databases is managed and scalable depending on the specific needs of the company at any momento.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Software as a Service (SaaS), so that machine learning, analytical models, and visualization can be implemented in a public (or private) cloud, while the company pays only for the services consumed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike the license fee model where customers would pay high license fees up front to install BDAI on-premises, the “as-a-Service” model offers customers access to BDAI capabilities on demand. In other words, instead of offering BDAI as a product subject to rapid technological obsolescence, BDAI is delivered as a pay-as-you-go service. In this way, companies do not need to make large investments in installations and updates of “packaged” solutions, thus drastically reducing the time it would normally take an installation (weeks or months).</p>
<p>By storing all data and applications in a central hub, companies choosing BDAIaaS could avoid the high price of hard drive space and the need to purchase and maintain their own hardware. BDAI delivery time would also be much shorter, and the usual problems associated with heavy installations would be avoided. Furthermore, since companies may pay per user, it could possible to choose which employees would have access to BDAI capabilities rather than buying in bulk for the entire organization, thus making IT purchasing more flexible.</p>
<h2 id="benefits-of-bdaiaas">Benefits of BDAIaaS</h2>
<p>BDAIaaS offers opportunities for organizations to rapidly process and analyze terabytes of data from widely dispersed sources and varied formats (e.g., text, images, etc.), making possible the flexible use of the capabilities provided by solution providers according to the specific needs of the firm.</p>
<p>Companies could have access to endless advanced BDAI capabilities that would always be up to date, through a pay-per-use model in which the company would be the one to decide which options to “activate” and which ones to “deactivate” according to their needs. BDAIaaS providers would be interested in providing their customers with a wide variety of options that meet their needs, each at a higher price.</p>
<p>Since cloud computing is at the heart of BDAIaaS, companies would have at their fingertips all the shared processing capacity they needed at any given time with the click of a button. Similarly, when companies no longer needed that capacity, they could simply “turn off” the cloud service and stop incurring unnecessary costs.</p>
<p>Companies could take advantage of BDAIaaS to minimize the costs of infrastructure and implementation of the different tools, in addition to quickly extracting meaning from complex data sets created from statistical analyses and models. In short, organizations would substantially improve the time to value generation.</p>
<p>Today research continues on what is the best option to deliver BDAIaaS solutions and how to make them mainstream for companies. Still, the “aaS” model is expected to grow strongly in the coming years, moving beyond the cloud to enter our daily lives through mobile devices, thus creating a rich universe of new services for consumers and businesses.</p>
