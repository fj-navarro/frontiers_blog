      <p>Business transformation is best managed when there are smart leaders who recognize the needs of the organization and are willing to guide it on the right direction. Smart leadership is a critical capability that companies need in order to address all the transformational changes required to build a data-driven culture in the organization. Furthermore, leadership is a critical competency to embrace Big Data throughout the organization and bring the benefits of data science to fruition.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, as companies increase their reliance on data and algorithms for decision-making and the automation of routine, information-intensive tasks increases, so does the importance of interpersonal leadership skills between smart transformational leaders. Companies that pursue deep transformation need good leaders with a vision not only to improve some processes and make them work more efficiently, but to profoundly transform the organization around three key areas: customer experience, operational processes, and new business models.</p>
<p>What is at stake is not only how to manage data and implement data-driven technologies to get the most out of it, but to give the organization a new impetus that makes it stronger and more competitive. In the end, it is about making organizations work in a more Agile way and be able to respond to the customer needs faster and precisely.</p>
<h2 id="the-new-smart-transformational-leader">The New Smart Transformational Leader</h2>
<p>Today every transformational leader understands that the world of technology and data is changing very rapidly, and they take very seriously how smart things are changing the way consumers and business behave. They are aware that Big Data, analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies are becoming ubiquitous and that a silent but powerful (smart) revolution is taking place that affects the management of organizations.</p>
<p>Smart transformational leaders have a clear mission: they work hard to make their organizations develop a smart mindset and be ready to respond to the disruptions caused by the use of smart (data-driven) technologies.</p>
<p>The huge demand for change brought about by this smart revolution makes it inevitable for organizations to build a greater capacity for innovation and transformation, and this fundamentally affects the leadership functions. In other words, without renewed leadership it is simply not possible for the business transformation process to succeed and for the organization to be reborn as a smart organization.</p>
<h2 id="new-leaders-new-mindset">New Leaders, New Mindset</h2>
<p>It is the job of smart transformational leaders to understand how transformation affects existing organizations and how they can be threatened if they do not change, do not become flexible, or do not reorganize towards increasingly digital and smart business models.</p>
<p>Becoming a smart organization requires well-defined leadership that shares a clear vision and goals and activates flexible talent management practices within an organizational culture that puts data at the center of the organization.</p>
<p>Smart transformational leaders encourage the use of data and successfully guide the organization to extract value from Big Data and analytics, making it easier for data applications to consistently deliver their benefits to the organization. This requires smart organizational decisions and the commitment of visionary leaders who inspire a new data-centric culture. To achieve this, they must become role models in the use of data, counting on the skills and abilities that allow them to overcome the technical and organizational obstacles that arise when it comes to creating value from data.</p>
<h2 id="smart-leaders-and-data-worship">Smart Leaders and Data Worship</h2>
<p>Smart transformational leaders view data as a key asset that all employees should have access to and know how to use. They understand that data and analytics can greatly enhance the organizationâ€™s ability to innovate and respond to changing customer needs and preferences, being, ultimately, an asset that strengthens the competitive advantage of their business.</p>
<p>Smart transformational leaders stand out because they emphasize the systematic use of data throughout the organization not only to address operational or tactical problems, or to create more compelling reports, but also to integrate data into decision-making processes that lead to the allocation of resources, put new products and services on the market, or promote changes in business models.</p>
<p>To achieve their goals, smart transformational leaders do not hesitate to build a flexible and decentralized organizational structure in which all its members collaborate and share their knowledge to extract value from data. In this way they unfold the capabilities to connect the &ldquo;big picture&rdquo; questions that all managers ask, with the more specific, low-level questions that machines can answer, thus reconciling machine-generated models with the nuances of human preferences.</p>
<p>Smart transformational leaders are definitely aware of the benefits of using data, but they are also aware of its limitations and adapt the role of data when it comes to formulating strategies and adjusting the expectations of data users within the organization. It comes as no surprise that they never stop communicating with the entire organization when data analytics reveals something insightful, because when the organization shares the insights generated by data, it reinforces the importance and usefulness of the data and encourages people to pursue this course of action.</p>
