    <div class="content">
      <p>Being clear about the main concepts surrounding that of digitalization is no longer straightforward. The term has been so abused by so many people with so many different intentions that it has ceased to be useful for sharing ideas with each other, and shrouded in tons of dust and without substance.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, the literature on digitalization and related disciplines does not help at all if we seek to clarify things. The production of knowledge around digitalization, with a fairly uneven and variable level of quality, let it be said, is simply gigantic and reflects the contribution of thousands of practitioners, consultants, technologists, and even public officials, who have contributed their own vision of the phenomenon in recent years, generally emphasizing those dimensions that most affected them.</p>
<p>The end result after long years of digitalization hype is a highly biased concept whose meaning depends on who uses it, when and in what context, and which currently lacks a significance shared by the community of transformational leaders. Let&rsquo;s see if this article can help clarify some related but different terms once and for all.</p>
<h2 id="academics-vs-professionals">Academics vs Professionals</h2>
<p>Although academics and practitioners generally take it for granted that digitalization affects and challenges business owners and managers in all industries and contexts, the truth is that there is an overwhelming lack of clarity when it comes to understanding it. One of the main challenges is that there is no reconciled definition of the core elements that make up digitalization.</p>
<p>In fact, many studies see digital transformation as entirely different things: for some authors it means only a slight change enabled by technology (i.e., when a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system is implemented in a department of a firm); for others it means the impact that technology has in the strategy or business model of an organization; while for others it implies a more profound and evolutionary approach that develops over time.</p>
<p>It is also quite worrying that there are several key terms, such as digitization and digitalization, whose differences are often unclear, and which add even more confusion and ambiguity when owners and managers use them as part of their organizations&rsquo; transformation processes.</p>
<h2 id="digitization">Digitization</h2>
<p>The term digitization means the conversion of information from an analog format to a digital one. It is a pure technical process that seeks to convert something that is analog into a binary language (composed of &ldquo;0s&rdquo; and &ldquo;1s&rdquo;), so that it can be processed by digital information systems (e.g., a computer, a smart phone, etc.). An example of digitization is converting a paper photo to a digital photo to store it on a flash drive, using a scanning process.</p>
<p>Digitization involves significant improvements in the use that organizations make of ICT and in guiding technology implementation strategies. This explains why technology adoption models and the criteria used to select ICT tools in a business context, as well as how data can be integrated into information systems, are common themes pertaining to digitization. In the end, digitization is the first and foremost step in advancing digitalization processes and, subsequently, in business transformation.</p>
<h2 id="digitalization">Digitalization</h2>
<p>Digitalization involves the use of data and digital technologies to optimize or automate management processes in the organization, including those related to the collection and analysis of data itself. Digitalization encompasses change processes that are much deeper than those of digitization, since it involves the use of technologies in a much broader organizational context. The terms computerization and informatization are concepts closely related to the notion of digitalization and are often used as synonyms.</p>
<h2 id="digital-transformation">Digital Transformation</h2>
<p>The term digital transformation is used by academics and professionals to refer to changes of all kinds that occur in human activity as a result of digitalization. For companies, digitalization embodies a socio-technological process whereby the application of digitalization is raised to a systemic level within the organization.</p>
<p>Digital transformation emphasizes aspects related to cultural change, the way in which the organization is managed, the roles of people, as well as the changes that occur in the operating environment as a result of the adoption of digital technologies. In other words, digital transformation implies a strategic change process focused on advancing the systematic digitalization of the firm while keeping the different business strategies in sync with the IT strategy.</p>
<p>Therefore, digital transformation is different from that of digitization and their meanings are not interchangeable. Meanwhile, both digitalization and digital transformation make use of digitization and digital innovation with the intention of improving the firm&rsquo;s products and services.</p>
